<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">In
Peter Singer&rsquo;s theory on famine, affluence, and morality, he is
establishing a claim that the current dynamic that exists between
affluent and poor people in its current state is not justified; in
fact society must realign their perception on the way of life as it
is today. Some commonly held assumptions must be agreed upon, the
first being that any suffering and death that is due to a lack of
food, shelter, or medicine is inherently bad. Singer claims that if
it is in our power to prevent any such suffering, without making a
sacrifice of an equal or greater moral significance, then we are
obligated to act. In support he offers the example of walking by a
pond where there is a child drowning. If we were to attempt to save
the child the only sacrifice made would be that of dirtying our
clothes, which is of no comparable importance to the life of the
child.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	The world we live
in is subject to the forces of globalization and these effects are
felt exponentially over time. Singer uses this idea, which he refers
to in terms of the world as a &ldquo;global village&rdquo;, in order
to dissuade any claims that distance to or from an instance of
suffering and death, or that the number of other people who also
ought to assist, enables one to forgo their own obligation. Proximity
to the suffering does not effect whether or not one ought to assist
in prevention. In addition, there is no moral distinction between
either if there are instances where I am the only one with the
capability to prevent suffering and death or if there are a thousand
others who are in an equivalent situation in regards to their ability
and capacity to help.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	As mentioned, the
world must reevaluate what it perceives as fulfillment of moral
standards in terms of assistance to the suffering of the poor. It is
not enough to just offer minimal aid and then continue to buy
frivolous commodities such as a luxurious car. To prevent some people
from giving as little as is necessary after others have contributed
much more, it is required that if we have the ability to assist we
must do so to our maximum capability. This means that we must
sacrifice up to the point of marginal utility &ndash; the point to
which if we gave one more unit, it would cause more harm on our end
then good on the other. Therefore the societal distinction between
duty and charity to the poor no longer exists given the acceptance of
these principles. In conclusion, if it is in our power to prevent
suffering, without making a sacrifice of an equal or greater moral
significance, then we are obligated to act and give to the maximum
extent without going beyond our marginal utility.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	The standards
Singer speaks of are absolutist, meaning that the actions are moral
or morally impermissible regardless of subjectivity. This leaves room
for critics to find flaws in his premises, such as those asserted by
Garrett Hardin. Hardin finds fault with two points in the original
premises, the first being that aid to prevent current starvation will
only delay the eventual death of these people and others in the same
situation. Another objection is of the claim that wealthy nations
should be giving maximum aid to suffering poor nations, Hardin denies
that any aid ought to be given. Hardin uses the metaphor of the world
as an ocean, in which the people of wealthy nations are in lifeboats
and the people of poor nations are swimming in the water. If the
lifeboats take on some of those swimming not only will it never be
fair and just determining who is saved, but in fact after a certain
point the boat will sink from the added duress created by the poorer
nations and its citizens. For context, if we were to slow the death
rate of the poor, whose current growth exceeds that of the affluent,
it will reach the point where the sheer numbers of all people will
exceed the sustainable capabilities of our planet. Therefore, we
ought to preserve our current situation so as to not doom all of
humanity and suffer a tragedy of the commons and deplete the
resources responsible for the wealth of nations. This is a clear
objection to the assertion that we must supply aid to our fullest
capability, due to the slippery slope which ends in compete collapse.
Although, Singer did foresee this objection and therefore claims we
should allocate our aid to help manage population control rather then
directly preventing the current suffering of the poor. Therefore, his
caveat to the original premises covers this particular objection even
though it is the strongest assertion against his original claim.  As
a whole, Singer&rsquo;s argument that we ought to prevent suffering
and death due to poverty, without sacrificing something of
significant moral importance remains valid and sound after thorough
examination.</p>
